Develop a simple web application for managing a contact list.
Functional Requirements:

Users can create new contacts by providing the following information:

- Contact name (text field);
- Contact's email (text field);
- Contact's phone number (text field).
Users can view a list of all contacts, sorted by name or email.

Each contact in the list should display information about:

- Contact's name;
- Contact's email;
- Contact's phone number.
Users can edit information about existing contacts, including name, email, and phone number.

Users can delete contacts from the list.


Technical Requirements:

Use plain Python to implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. You can use libraries but not frameworks.

There are no specific design requirements.

Note: Implementation details such as setting up the database or other technical aspects may be omitted in this task, as the main focus is on the functional requirements and the overall architecture of the application.
